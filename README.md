# upspeak-app
This repository holds everything from the development of my English course app. This is a personal project.

This is where I'm putting into practice everything I've been learning as a full stack developer.
Also, this is intended to be used by my students to learn English. It will englobe the lenguage learning method I've created and help the student in every step.
